## Overview

The Bullseye Layout is designed to both horizontally and vertically center a single child element within its parent.

## Usage

| Class | Applied to | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-l-bullseye` | `<div>` | Initializes the bullseye layout. A bullseye can only have one child. |
| `.pf-l-bullseye__item` |  `<div>` | Explicitly sets the child for the bullseye. This class isn't necessary, but it is included to keep inline with BEM convention, and to provide an entity that will later be used for applying modifiers. |
